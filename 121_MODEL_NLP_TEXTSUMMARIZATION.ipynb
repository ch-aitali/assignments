The third D stands for determination: You must be willing to persist in the face of all temptations to the contrary until you have become an effective time manager. Your desire will reinforce your determination. time management a lifelong practice. Effective discipline is whether you feel like it or not. This is critical for success. American Management Association / www.amanet.org INTRODUCTION 3 The payoff for becoming an excellent time manager is huge. It is the outwardly identifiable quality of a high per- former vs. a low performer. All winners in life use their time well. All poor performers in life use their time poorly. One of the most important rules for success is simply to “form good learn how to form good habits and then let them form you. What you will learn in this book are the twenty-one most important solutions to effective time management that almost all highly productive people have discovered and incorporated into their lives.

Each one sup- ports and reinforces the other. The Law of Control The psychology of time management is based on a simple principle called the Law of Control. This law says that you feel good about yourself to the degree to which you feel you are in control of your own life. This law also says that you feel negative about yourself to the degree to which you feel that you are not in control of your own life or work. Psychologists refer to the difference between an internal feel that you are controlled by circumstances outside yourself. pressure of your work and responsibilities. You feel that you really in charge of your time and your life. Most of what you external events. There is a big difference between action that is self- immediate response to external pressure.

Your Thoughts and Feelings internal master program that regulates his behavior in every important area of life. People with a high self-concept regarding time management see themselves and think about themselves as being well organized and productive. They are very much in charge of their lives and their work. especially regarding the way you manage your time. Some people believe themselves to be extremely well organized and efficient. Others feel continuously overwhelmed by demands of other people and circumstances. Beliefs Become Realities What are your beliefs about yourself and your ability to manage your own time? Do you see yourself and think about yourself as a highly efficient and effective time manager? Do you believe you are highly productive and in complete con- urally do those things that are consistent with that belief.

Visualize Yourself as You Want to Be The second way to transform your behaviors is to visualize yourself as an excellent time manager. See yourself as orga - person you “see” on the inside is the person you will “be” on the outside. If you are already a well-organized and highly productive different from the way you behave today?

American Management Association / www.amanet.org THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TIME MANAGEMENT 9 Imagine what a highly productive person would look like. Would the person’s desk be clear and tidy? Would the person appear unhurried and unstressed? Create a clear mental picture of yourself as a person who is in control of his time and life. Act “As If” The third way to program yourself is to act “as if” you were already a good time manager. Think of yourself as being well organized in everything you do. If you were already excellent you be doing differently? With regard to your time and per- you do things now? American Management Association / www.amanet.org TWO Determine Your Values improving your personal productivity begins with an exam- ination of your values. One of Murphy’s Laws says that It’s not possible to manage your time properly unless you know exactly what your values are. Good time management requires that you bring your control over a sequence of events into harmony with what is will never feel motivated and determined to get control of your time. Ask yourself this: “Why am I doing what I am doing?” Why do you get up in the morning? Why do you do the job you do? What is your reason for working where you work? American Management Association / www.amanet.org DETERMINE YOUR VALUES 11 Meaning and Purpose Each person has a deep need for meaning and purpose in life. One of the major reasons for personal stress and unhap- piness is the feeling that what you are doing has no meaning and purpose as it applies to you and your innermost values and convictions. You must always start off by asking the question “Why?” You can become more efficient with time management more efficient at doing something that is meaningless to you. Greater efficiency will simply increase your sense of What Do You Value Most? most in life?” What do you really care about and stand for? What will you not stand for? to the degree to which your day-to-day activities are in har- one thing while you believe and value something com- pletely different. There are many reports about executives experiencing burnout as the result of the stress of their work. But people experience stress or burnout of any kind. When you are American Management Association / www.amanet.org 12 TIME MANAGEMENT comes from working at things that are not consistent with your highest values. You Are Extraordinary Realize and accept that you are a unique and wonderful per- son. Your values have grown and evolved over the course of your entire lifetime. They have emerged as the result of countless influences and experiences. They are part of your psychological and emotional DNA. They are part of your character and personality. They seldom change over time. Your job is to determine what your innermost values really working consistent with those values. Analyze Yourself Here are four sentence completion exercises that you can use to gain better insight into the person you really are inside. Complete each sentence: really?” what would be your answer?

Would you describe American Management Association / www.amanet.org DETERMINE YOUR VALUES 13 other people describe you in terms of your values and the person you really are? Based on the way you behave and about the person you are inside? around you. How would you describe the human race? Are untrustworthy? Your answer will have a major influence on how you treat other people in every part of your life. It will determine just about everything you will accomplish as an executive and as a person with family and friends.

When you become clear about your answers—which will not be easy—you can then ask yourself what changes you would need to make to bring your time usage and your life priorities more into alignment with each other. Napoleon Hill observed that life only begins to become great when we decide clearly upon our most important goal in life. What are your most important goals? American Management Association / www.amanet.org THREE Think About Your Vision and Mission ONE OF THE BEST and most profound books written in the His insight is that we need to use two different types of thinking to deal with the variety of situations we face in our daily lives. Fast thinking is the type of thinking that we use to deal and situations. We act quickly and instinctively. In most day activities. The second type of thinking that Kahneman describes is slow thinking. That’s when you step back and take more time to carefully think through the details of the situation before deciding what you are going to do. Kahneman’s American Management Association / www.amanet.org 16 TIME MANAGEMENT insight is that the failure to engage in slow thinking when it is required and necessary is the cause of many of the mis- takes that we make in life. am I trying to do?” Think Before Acting Very often you can find yourself working extremely hard at and think about what it is you really want to accomplish.

Are you working because you accomplish something that is very important? What would your world look like if you accomplished your biggest goal? What is your vision for yourself and your career over the long term? What is your mission? What dif- ference do you want to make in the lives of other people? If all you are working for is to earn enough money to pay tain a high level of commitment and enthusiasm. To be truly makes a difference in the life or work of others.

Once you are clear about what you are trying to do and tion: “How is it going?” Is what you are doing moving you toward what you want in the fastest and most efficient way? Are you happy with your too many roadblocks and obstacles on your journey? What are your assumptions about your work and your life? What are your conscious assumptions? What are your unconscious and often unquestioned assumptions? It is amazing how many hardworking people are laboring on the basis of false assumptions that they have never questioned. Seek a Better Way also be considering another important question: “Could there be a better way?” The fact is that there is almost always a different and bet- ter way to achieve a business goal. This other way may be American Management Association / www.amanet.org THINK ABOUT YOUR VISION AND MISSION 19 than just increasing its speed.” Many people are working very hard but going in the wrong direction on the wrong path. They are not clear about but they don’t want to face or deal with the possibility that they could be wrong. The process of asking tough questions speed at which you achieve your business goals and your vision and mission. American Management Association / www.amanet.org FOUR Look Backward WHAT IS THE MOST important and valuable work that you think clearly about what you do and how you do it will have a greater impact on your future results than any other single action you take. There are some areas of your work where “slow thinking” is absolutely essential for you to perform at your best.

Think of where you are today and where you want to be in five years. Look at the activities that you are engaged in today and determine which of them can have the greatest impact on your future. This way of thinking will allow you to manage your time much better than you can idea gained in a period of solitude or contemplation can save you months and even years of hard work. Long Time Perspective Dr. Edward Banfield of Harvard University conducted more than fifty years of research into the attitudes and behaviors He identified one special quality that seemed to separate the high performers from the low performers. He called it “long time perspective.” Banfield found that high performers took American Management Association / www.amanet.org 22 TIME MANAGEMENT wanted to be in their lives and work at that time.

Successful people are very clear about who plans of action that they follow every day. Once you have set a larger goal for yourself and your 1.

What could you offer in exchange to gain this person’s help and cooperation so that you achieve your important goals even faster? detailed plans of action before they begin. Make written plans carefully until they are successful. American Management Association / www.amanet.org SIX Chart Your Projects MOST wWoRK IN business is a series of projects. Your ability to complete projects largely determines your success in your career. A project is defined as a “multitask job.” A project is a result that requires the completion of a series of many smaller jobs. Perhaps the most powerful tool you can use to maximize your effectiveness and dramatically increase your level of accomplishment is a checklist. A checklist consists of a writ- in advance of beginning work in the first place. Your ability to clearly define and determine the steps that you will have to take from where you are today to a success- fully completed project is a mark of superior thinking. The American Management Association / www.amanet.org 30 TIME MANAGEMENT creating checklists will save you ten minutes in execution and getting the job done. This is another example of slow thinking that can significantly increase your effectiveness Create a PERT Chart Create a visual representation of your larger tasks and proj- ects so that you and others can see it in its totality. Begin by determining the goals and objectives you must achieve to enjoy the outcomes you desire. Start with the end in mind. Take the time to develop absolute clarity about what your goals would look like if they were accomplished you need to take to get from where you are to where you want to be. The use of a PERT chart (which stands for Program Evaluation Review Technique) sets out graphically all the steps you need to take and when each one needs to be fin- ished for you to achieve the final goal. This technique is used by the most efficient and effective companies and executives worldwide. A PERT chart enables you to see a variety of ways to achieve the task with greater efficiency.

American Management Association / www.amanet.org SEVEN Create Your Daily “To-Do” List PERHAPS THE MOST powerful time management tool is a daily list of activities that you create to serve as a blueprint for your day. All successful time managers think on paper and work from a daily list of activities. Just as a pilot uses a checklist to create a “to-do” list before they begin each day. subconscious mind can work on your list while you sleep. and insights to help you achieve some of the most important goals on your list. plan out the next day. In a study of more than fifty highly American Management Association / www.amanet.org CREATE YOUR DAILY “TO-DO” LIST 35 that the best time management system they had ever found was a simple pad of paper on which they wrote down every- thing they had to do before they began. Sleep Better Many people toss and turn at night trying not to forget something they have to do the following day. If you create a and awake more refreshed. twelve minutes each day to write out a list of your tasks for that day. But this list will save you ten times that amount of time in improved productivity. Twelve minutes spent in begin work. That’s an incredible payoff for such a simple task. The ABCDE Method Once you have made up a list of everything that you plan to method to your activities. The most important word in time management is conse- quences. A task is important depending on the potential consequences of doing it or not doing it. When you set pri- begin with the task that has the greatest consequences. This is where the ABCDE method is especially helpful. American Management Association / www.amanet.org 36 TIME MANAGEMENT Begin by making a list of everything you have to do the item on your list before you begin work. An item that’s marked A is something you must do. It is something that is important and there are serious conse- quences for either doing it or not doing it. Put an A next to those tasks and activities that you must accomplish in the course of the day if you are to fulfill your responsibilities. B items are those things you should do. There are mild not as important as A activities. The rule is that you never do a B activity when there is an A activity left undone. not you do them has no consequences at all in terms of your effectiveness at your job.

Many people get into the habit of coming in to work and American Management Association / www.amanet.org CREATE YOUR DAILY “TO-DO” LIST 37 But whatever you do repeatedly soon becomes a habit. It is unfortunate that the great majority of people at work today have established the habit of wasting most of their time on activities that contribute nothing to their businesses or to their careers.

American Management Association / www.amanet.org EIGHT Set Clear Priorities | HAVE STUDIED time management for more than thirty books of my own on time management that are worldwide and conducted seminars and workshops on time manage- ment all over the world. What I discovered was simple: All of time management boils down to helping you determine the most important tools and techniques to begin immediately with that one American Management Association / www.amanet.org SET CLEAR PRIORITIES 41 I explained the ABCDE method in the last chapter. It is one of the most powerful priority-setting methods ever dis- covered. There are a series of additional techniques that you can also use to set priorities. The Pareto Principle accumulation of fortunes in every society. After years of families—those he called the “vital few’”—controlled 80 per- cent of the wealth and property throughout Europe. The 80/20 rule seems to apply to almost all areas of cent of the value of all the work that you do. Peter Drucker says that often it is the “90/10 rule.” Sometimes 10 percent of the work that you do will account for 90 percent of the value. When you start off each day with a list of your tasks and list and select the top 20 percent of tasks that can make the greatest contribution to achieving your most important goals and objectives.

You would probably be astonished at how much work you could get done in that single day. You would probably complete the top 20 percent of the tasks that you had planned for the entire week. single minute. You would have no time at all for idle conver- sation with your coworkers. You would start early and im- mediately work through coffee breaks and lunch and concentrate single-mindedly on clearing your desk by com- pleting your most important tasks. You would become one ally overnight. This is a great exercise for you to practice on yourself. This exercise just illustrates the fact that your efficiency and effectiveness is largely a matter of choice. With a suffi- immediately become one of the most valuable people in your organization. The Law of Three This principle is probably worth the cost and time of reading this book. It is based on an amazing discovery that I have American Management Association / www.amanet.org 44 TIME MANAGEMENT three tasks and activities that account for 90 percent of the value of the contribution you make to your business. If you make a list of everything you do in the course ofa different tasks and responsibilities. But if you review that list on your entire list account for 90 percent of your value to your business. How do you determine your “big three’? Simple. Make a which one activity would contribute the greatest value to my business?

Think of yourself as an “earning machine.” Every task high or low. Your job is to focus on the most valuable use of your time and to discipline yourself to continually work on those few activities that contribute the greatest value to your work and to your business. A Lifestyle Principle This selection of the most valuable use of your time applies to is to go home and go to bed early and get a good night's sleep. Sometimes the most valuable use of your time is to spend it face-to-face with the important people in your life. Sometimes the most valuable use of your time is to take excellent care of ation that you need to perform at your best. Sometimes the most valuable use of your time is just to spend it with your family or to read a good book rather than of your time will be to socialize; to get together with family and friends whose company you enjoy so that you can relax and de-stress.

The Important vs. the Urgent largely about separating the “vital few” from the “trivial many.” There are four different types of tasks that you are faced with every day. Your ability to sort out these tasks into their proper categories can significantly increase your pro- ductivity. Each of these tasks can be put into a different box or quadrant. QUADRANT 1: URGENT AND IMPORTANT An important task is something that has long-term conse- quences for your career. An urgent task is something that can- not be delayed or put off. A task that is both urgent and important is something that is “in your face.” It is largely deter- sibilities that you must start and complete in order to keep on are expecting you to accomplish. Most people spend most of their working day on tasks that are both vital and urgent. both urgent and important. This is called the “quadrant of immediacy.” American Management Association / www.amanet.org 50 TIME MANAGEMENT The second type of tasks are those that are important but least for the short term. An example of a task that is vital but not urgent is an important report that you must have Or think about a college term paper. It is something that is often is.

These tasks fall into the “quadrant of effectiveness.” American Management Association / www.amanet.org STAY ON TRACK 51 them contribute little or no value to your business or your work. They represent tasks that are urgent but not important. These tasks fall into what is often called the “quadrant of delusion.” People think that because they are engaging in vance.

Most of these activities involve idle conver- QUADRANT 4: NOT URGENT AND NOT IMPORTANT The fourth type of activity that people engage in at work are those tasks that are neither urgent nor important. These activ- ities fall into the “quadrant of waste.” Many people engage in activities that have zero value to either themselves or the appointments listening to the radio—all are examples of activities that are neither urgent nor important. They are a complete waste of time. They contribute nothing to your life. Develop Good Work Habits American Management Association / www.amanet.org 52 TIME MANAGEMENT break. Many people have developed the habit of spending most of their time on low-value/no-value activities and then are quite astonished when they are laid off from their jobs or passed over for promotion. The key to good time management is for you to set prior- ities and to always be working on what is both urgent and Once you are caught up with your tasks that are urgent and are important but not urgent at the moment. The tasks that are important but not urgent are usually those tasks and activities that can contribute to your career in a meaningful way in the long term. American Management Association / www.amanet.org TEN Determine Your Key Result Areas PERHAPS THE MOST important key to high productivity is for you to focus and concentrate on the most valuable and Developing absolute clarity about your key result areas is essential for executive effectiveness and high productivity. Your key result areas are those things that you have been ities in terms of the value that you contribute to your busi- whether or not you fulfill your responsibilities to your com- pany and to yourself. What are the key results that you have been hired to accomplish? Try asking the question another way: “Why are American Management Association / www.amanet.org 54 TIME MANAGEMENT you on the payroll?” This is a key organizing question that you should be asking yourself every minute of every day— especially when you are overwhelmed by too much to do and too little time. A key result area (KRA) can be defined as having three specific qualities: do to fulfill the responsibilities and demands of your job. 2. It is something for which you are 100 percent one else who can or will do it for you. 3. It is something that is completely under your con- trol.

These are the specific activities that contribute the greatest value to your work. For you to about what those activities are that are more valuable than to your success or to your contributions. Focusing on key result areas is the most direct way to energy. You always get a tremendous feeling of self-confi- dence and personal power from completing something that is significant and important both to you and your company. achieving your major goals. American Management Association / www.amanet.org 56 TIME MANAGEMENT Define Your Key Result Areas There are seldom more than five to seven key result areas in any job. Each KRA is a specific task that you must do if you are to complete the overall output responsibilities of your work. areas are: 2.

Each of your subordinates must also know what their key to be accomplished. American Management Association / www.amanet.org ELEVEN Delegate to Others ONE OF THE GREATEST time management tools is for you to get someone else to do the task completely. Your ability to delegate lower-value tasks to others who can do them at a lower hourly rate or salary is one of the vital skills of modern management. Delegate everything you possibly can to others who can do the tasks as well as or better than you. Use the “70 percent rule.” If someone else can do a particular task 70 percent as your plate and on to that person's plate. Multiply Your Value Delegation enables you to move from what you can do personally to what you can manage. Delegation is the skill American Management Association / www.amanet.org 60 TIME MANAGEMENT that allows you to leverage your talent and skill and multi- ply it times all the people who can be given smaller parts of the work. can have someone else do it. High productivity requires that you always think in terms of the latter approach: “Who else can do this job rather than me?” Delegation Is Learnable Learn the skills of proper delegation. ( have written an entire minibook in this series that tells you everything you need to know to maximize your productivity through other people.) Choose the right person to handle each task. and a review schedule. You can also delegate problem solving and decision making if they are among your duties and responsibilities. You can delegate information gathering and research. You can delegate every task that anyone else can do as well as (or almost as well as) you. there is no limit that you cannot reach in your professional career. But without the ability to delegate efficiently and tle time. You will end up doing too many things of low value or no value. You will never get caught up and on top of your job. And this can hurt your career. American Management Association / www.amanet.org DELEGATE TO OTHERS 61 The best news is that all business skills are learnable. Every idea in this book is something that you can master with practice and repetition.

American Management Association / www.amanet.org TWELVE Concentrate Single-Mindedly CONCENTRATION AND single-handling are essential requirements for all great achievement.

Avoid Multitasking There is a good deal of argument today over the concept of multitasking. Some people feel that they are quite capable of performing at high levels of productivity while they are working on several tasks at once. The studies have now proven that this idea is totally false. What the experts have discovered is that multitasking is actually “task-shifting.” The fact is that you can only do one thing at a time.

One of the best techniques of all is to divide your task into “bite-size pieces.” Take a piece of paper and write down every small part of the to the final job that completes the task. forcing yourself to start on a major task will help you to develop the momentum and energy necessary to work right through until the task is complete. The Salami Slice Method A variation of the “bite-size pieces” technique for overcom- ing procrastination is called the “salami slice method.” Just salami-slice the task; you reduce the size of the task by slic- ing off one small part at a time.

You need a minimum of sixty to ninety minutes to accomplish anything worthwhile. It takes about thirty focused work. American Management Association / www.amanet.org 72 TIME MANAGEMENT Don’t Mix Creative and Administrative You cannot mix creative tasks with functional or administra- tive tasks. You cannot really do operational tasks and creative Think of creative time as your “internal prime time” and operational time as your “external prime time.” And don't mix them up. You cannot do big creative jobs requiring focus and concentration in a typical office environment unless you must be creative in finding ways to get away from your work environment so that you can complete the tasks that your career really depends on. How to Create Chunks of Time Here are several recommendations for creating blocks of tiveness and efficiency. and most alert. Many of the most productive people in business discipline themselves to go to bed early and then arise at 5:00 or 6:00 A.M. so that they can work for sixty to ninety minutes uninterrupted before they go into the office. as the average person does in an office environment in three hours. American Management Association / www.amanet.org CREATE BLOCKS OF TIME 73 Another time that you can use to your advantage is lunchtime. This is a great opportunity for you to shut off other distractions while everyone else is out of the office having lunch. You'll have sixty straight minutes of peace and quiet where you can work single-mindedly to clear up some of your most important tasks. Do Not Disturb Another strategy you can use is to close your office door for certain periods each day during which you work single- mindedly on your biggest tasks. Many executives will get a Do Nor Disturs sign from a hotel and hang it on their door handle at work. Everyone knows that while this sign is on the of areal emergency. to me that she was overwhelmed with nonstop interruptions detailed accounting work done and send out her financial statements and reports on schedule.

American Management Association / www.amanet.org 74 TIME MANAGEMENT Gain Extra Hours Here is yet another great technique that virtually all execu- tives on the fast track use. It is so simple that it should be ille- gal. Get up a little earlier and arrive at your office one hour before everyone else. Use that hour to organize your day and to get started before there are any possible interruptions. Then work through lunch and gain one more hour of pro- plete your most important tasks. This is an amazing technique!

These interruptions can be in the form of a bell going off on your because they need to talk. It turns out that people are the greatest time wasters in the world of work.

called self effi American Management Association www amanet org THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TIME MANAGEMENT the more productive and capable you will be Each one sup ports and reinforces the other The Law of Control The psychology of time management is based on a simple principle called the Law of Control This law says that you feel good about yourself to the degree to which you feel you are in control of your own life This law also says that you feel negative about yourself to the degree to which you feel that you are not in control of your own life or work Psychologists refer to the difference between an internal feel that you are controlled by circumstances outside yourself pressure of your work and responsibilities You feel that you really in charge of your time and your life Most of what you external events There is a big difference between action that is self immediate response to external pressure It s the difference between feeling positive and in control of your life and feel

important area of life People with a high self concept regarding time management see themselves and think about themselves as being well organized and productive They are very much in charge of their lives and their work especially regarding the way you manage your time Some people believe themselves to be extremely well organized and efficient Others feel continuously overwhelmed by demands of other people and circumstances Beliefs Become Realities What are your beliefs about yourself and your ability to manage your own time Do you see yourself and think about yourself as a highly efficient and effective time manager Do you believe you are highly productive and in complete con urally do those things that are consistent with that belief Because your self concept causes you to continually

control of his time and life Act As If The third way to program yourself is to act as if you were already a good time manager Think of yourself as being well organized in everything you do If you were already excellent you be doing differently With regard to your time and per you do things now American Management Association www amanet org TWO Determine Your Values improving your personal productivity begins with an exam ination of your values One of Murphy s Laws says that It s not possible to manage your time properly unless you know exactly what your values are Good time management requires that you bring your control over a sequence of events into harmony with what is will never feel motivated and determined to get control of your time Ask yourself this Why am I doing what I am doing Why do you get up in the morning Why do you do the job you do What is your reason for working where you work American Management Association www amanet org DETERMINE YOUR VALUES Meaning and Purpose Each person has a deep need for meaning and purpose in life One of the major reasons for personal stress and unhap piness is the feeling that what you are doing has no meaning and purpose as it applies to you and your innermost values and convictions You must always start off by asking the question Why You can become more efficient with time management more efficient at doing something that is meaningless to you Greater efficiency will simply increase your sense of What Do You Value Most most in life What do you really care about and stand for What will you not stand for to the degree to which your day to day activities are in har one thing while you believe and value something com pletely different There are many reports about executives experiencing burnout as the result of the stress of their work But people experience stress or burnout of any kind When you are American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT comes from working at things that are not consistent with your highest values You Are Extraordinary Realize and accept that you are a unique and wonderful per son Your values have grown and evolved over the course of your entire lifetime They have emerged as the result of countless influences and experiences They are part of your psychological and emotional DNA They are part of your character and personality They seldom change over time Your job is to determine what your innermost values really working consistent with those values Analyze Yourself Here are four sentence completion exercises that you can use to gain better insight into the person you really are inside Complete each sentence really what would be your answer What are the first words that you would use to describe yourself Would you describe American Management Association www amanet org DETERMINE YOUR VALUES other people describe you in terms of your values and the person you really are Based on the way you behave and about the person you are inside around you How would you describe the human race Are untrustworthy Your answer will have a major influence on how you treat other people in every part of your life It will determine just about everything you

amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT a My biggest goal in life is If you could wave a magic My biggest goal in my career is My biggest goal for my family is These are some of the most profound and important questions you can ever ask and answer for yourself When you become clear about your answers which will not be easy you can then ask yourself what changes you would need to make to bring your time usage and your life priorities more into alignment with each other Napoleon Hill observed that life only begins to become great when we decide clearly upon our most important goal in life What are your most important goals American Management Association www amanet org THREE Think About Your Vision and Mission ONE OF THE BEST and most profound books written in the His insight is that we need to use two different types of thinking to deal with the variety of situations we face in our daily lives Fast thinking is the type of thinking that we use to deal and situations We act quickly and instinctively In most day activities The second type of thinking that Kahneman describes is slow thinking That s when you step back and take more time to carefully think through the details of the situation before deciding what you are going to do Kahneman s American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT insight is that the failure to engage in slow thinking when it is required and necessary is the cause of many of the mis takes that we make in life am I trying to do Think Before Acting Very often you can find yourself working extremely hard at and think about what it is you really want to accomplish There is the story of the husband and wife who leave on a car trip from San Diego to Los Angeles He is unfamiliar with the road but driving at full speed in any case At a cer Los Angeles just passed a sign that said we are on the road to Phoenix must develop absolute clarity about what you are really try ing to accomplish definition of fanaticism is redoubling your efforts after your aim has been forgotten Is your goal to create a great life Are you trying to builda great career or accomplish a great piece of work Your ability American Management Association www amanet org THINK ABOUT YOUR VISION AND MISSION to stand back and engage in self analysis and introspec tion slow thinking is essential for you to organize your Keep the End in Mind Be clear about what outcomes you desire As Stephen Covey achieve Where do you want to end up at the end of the day leaning against the right building Are you working so that you can earn enough money to be secure and to feel happy Are you working because you accomplish something that is very important What would your world look like if you accomplished your biggest goal What is your vision for yourself and your career over the long term What is your mission What dif ference do you want to make in the lives of other people If all you are working for is to earn enough money to pay tain a high level of commitment and enthusiasm To be truly makes a difference in the life or work of others American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT Examine Your Methodology insights that will allow you to look at your situation and know whether you are on the right track Once you are clear about what you are trying to do and tion How is it going Is what you are doing moving you toward what you want in the fastest and most efficient way Are you happy with your too many roadblocks and obstacles on your journey What are your assumptions about your work and your life What are your conscious assumptions What are your unconscious and often unquestioned assumptions It is amazing how many hardworking people are laboring on the basis of false assumptions that they have never questioned Seek a Better Way also be considering another important question Could there be a better way The fact is that there is almost always a different and bet ter way to achieve a business goal This other way may be American Management Association www amanet org THINK ABOUT YOUR VISION AND MISSION than just increasing its speed Many people are working very hard but going in the wrong direction on the wrong path They are not clear about but they don t want to face or deal with the possibility that they could be wrong The process of asking tough questions speed at which you achieve your business goals and your vision and mission American Management Association www amanet org FOUR Look Backward WHAT IS THE MOST important and valuable work that you think clearly about what you do and how you do it will have a greater impact on your future results than any other single action you take There are some areas of your work where slow thinking is absolutely essential for you to perform at your best Take thirty minutes or more each day to review your effective men and women set aside this time each day to carefully consider what they are going to do before they American Management Association www amanet org you are doing before you take action autobiographies of successful men and women in every field One common thread in these biographies that I discovered achieve the greatness you are capable of when you begin to Take the time to evaluate your life and your activities in a larger context Think of where you are today and where you want to be in five years Look at the activities that you are engaged in today and determine which of them can have the greatest impact on your future This way of thinking will allow you to manage your time much better than you can idea gained in a period of solitude or contemplation can save you months and even years of hard work Long Time Perspective Dr Edward Banfield of Harvard University conducted more than fifty years of research into the attitudes and behaviors He identified one special quality that seemed to separate the high performers from the low performers He called it long time perspective Banfield found that high performers

the moment is consistent with where they want to be in the future your life situation is ideal in every way Create a clear mental picture of what your work situation would be if it were per yourself if what you are doing right now is consistent with the creation of your ideal future take to get to where you want to go This back from the future thinking is a practice of many top executives Make Better Decisions in the Present very successful in business in her adult life With this clear extra hours to get excellent grades in high school so that she harder courses and studies much longer than her peers to graduate as close as possible to the top of her class American Management Association www amanet org where she has the opportunity to get paid more and pro moted faster than classmates

Control The psychology of time management is based on a simple principle called the Law of Control This law says that you feel good about yourself to the degree to which you feel you are in control of your own life This law also says that you feel negative about yourself to the degree to which you feel that you are not in control of your own life or work Psychologists refer to the difference between an internal feel that you are controlled by circumstances outside yourself pressure of your work and responsibilities You feel that you really in charge of your time and your life Most of what

lives and their work especially regarding the way you manage your time Some people believe themselves to be extremely well organized and efficient Others feel continuously overwhelmed by demands of other people and circumstances Beliefs Become Realities What are your beliefs about yourself and your ability to manage your own time Do you see yourself and think about yourself as a highly efficient and effective time manager Do you believe you are highly productive and in complete con urally do those things that are consistent with that belief Because your self concept causes you to continually

as an excellent time manager See yourself as orga person you see on the inside is the person you will be on the outside If you are already a well organized and highly productive different from the way you behave today Create a picture of and able to complete large amounts of work in a short period of time American Management Association www amanet org THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TIME MANAGEMENT Imagine what a highly productive person would look like Would the person s desk be clear and tidy Would the person appear unhurried and unstressed Create a clear mental picture of yourself as a person who is in control of his time and life Act As If The third way to program yourself is to act as if you were already a good time manager Think of yourself as being well organized in everything you do If you were already excellent you be doing differently With regard to your time and per you do things now American Management Association www amanet org TWO Determine Your Values improving your personal productivity begins with an exam ination of your values One of Murphy s Laws says that It s not possible to manage your time properly unless you know exactly what your values are Good time management requires that you bring your control over a sequence of events into harmony with what is will never feel motivated and determined to get control of your time Ask yourself this Why am I doing what I am doing Why do you get up in the morning Why do you do the job you do What is your reason for working where you work American Management Association www amanet org DETERMINE YOUR VALUES Meaning and Purpose Each person has a deep need for meaning and purpose in life One of the major reasons for personal stress and unhap piness is the feeling that what you are doing has no meaning and purpose as it applies to you and your innermost values and convictions You must always start off by asking the question Why You can become more efficient with time management more efficient at doing something that is meaningless to you Greater efficiency will simply increase your sense of What Do You Value Most most in life What do you really care about and stand for What will you not stand for to the degree to which your day to day activities are in har one thing while you believe and value something com pletely different There are many reports about executives experiencing burnout as the result of the stress of their work But people experience stress or burnout of any kind When you are American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT comes from working at things that are not consistent with your highest values You Are Extraordinary Realize and accept that you are a unique and wonderful per son Your values have grown and evolved over the course of your entire lifetime They have emerged as the result of countless influences and experiences They are part of your psychological and emotional DNA They are part of your character and personality They seldom change over time Your job is to determine what your innermost values really working consistent with those values Analyze Yourself Here are four sentence completion exercises that you can use to gain better insight into the person you really are inside Complete each sentence really what would be your answer What are the first words that you would use to describe yourself Would you describe American Management Association www amanet org DETERMINE YOUR VALUES other people describe you in terms of your values and the person you really are Based on the way you behave and about the person you are inside around you How would you describe the human race Are untrustworthy Your answer will have a major influence on how you treat other people in every part of your life It will determine just about everything you will accomplish as an executive and as a person with family and friends One of my favorite stories is about a young man who nothing at all What is life to you American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT a My biggest goal in life is If you could wave a magic My biggest goal in my career is My biggest goal for my family is These are some of the most profound and important questions you can ever ask and answer for yourself When you become clear about your answers which will not be easy you can then ask yourself what changes you would need to make to bring your time usage and your life priorities more into alignment with each other Napoleon Hill observed that life only begins to become great when we decide clearly upon our most important goal in life What are your most important goals American Management Association www amanet org THREE Think About Your Vision and Mission ONE OF THE BEST and most profound books written in the His insight is that we need to use two different types of thinking to deal with the variety of situations we face in our daily lives Fast thinking is the type of thinking that we use to deal and situations We act quickly and instinctively In most day activities The second type of thinking that Kahneman describes is slow thinking That s when you step back and take more time to carefully think through the details of the situation before deciding what you are going to do Kahneman s American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT insight is that the failure to engage in slow thinking when it is required and necessary is the cause of many of the mis takes that we make in life am I trying to do Think Before Acting Very often you can find yourself working extremely hard at and think about what it is you really want to accomplish There is the story of the husband and wife who leave on a car trip from San Diego to Los Angeles He is unfamiliar with the road but driving at full speed in any case At a cer Los Angeles just passed a sign that said we are on the road to Phoenix must develop absolute clarity about what you are really try ing to accomplish definition of fanaticism is redoubling your efforts after your aim has been forgotten Is your goal to create a great life Are you trying to builda great career or accomplish a great piece of work Your ability American Management Association www amanet org THINK ABOUT YOUR VISION AND MISSION to stand back and engage in self analysis and introspec tion slow thinking is essential for you to organize your Keep the End in Mind Be clear about what outcomes you desire As Stephen Covey achieve Where do you want to end up at the end of the day leaning against the right building Are you working so that you can earn enough money to be secure and to feel happy Are you working because you accomplish something that is very important What would your world look like if you accomplished your biggest goal What is your vision for yourself and your career over the long term What is your mission What dif ference do you want to make in the lives of other people If all you are working for is to earn enough money to pay tain a high level of commitment and enthusiasm To be truly makes a difference in the life or work of others American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT Examine Your Methodology insights that will allow you to look at your situation and know whether you are on the right track Once you are clear about what you are trying to do and tion How is it going Is what you are doing moving you toward what you want in the fastest and most efficient way Are you happy with your too many roadblocks and obstacles on your journey What are your assumptions about your work and your life What are your conscious assumptions What are your unconscious and often unquestioned assumptions It is amazing how many hardworking people are laboring on the basis of false assumptions that they have never questioned Seek a Better Way also be considering another important question Could there be a better way The fact is that there is almost always a different and bet ter way to achieve a business goal This other way may be American Management Association www amanet org THINK ABOUT YOUR VISION AND MISSION than just increasing its speed Many people are working very hard but going in the wrong direction on the wrong path They are not clear about but they don t want to face or deal with the possibility that they could be wrong The process of asking tough questions speed at which you achieve your business goals and your vision and mission American Management Association www amanet org FOUR Look Backward WHAT IS THE MOST important and valuable work that you think clearly about what you do and how you do it will have a greater impact on your future results than any other single action you take There are some areas of your work where slow thinking is absolutely essential for you to perform at your best Take thirty minutes or more each day to review your effective men and women set aside this time each day to carefully consider what they are going to do before they American Management Association www amanet org you are doing before you take action autobiographies of successful men and women in every field One common thread in these biographies that I discovered achieve the greatness you are capable of when you begin to Take the time to evaluate your life and your activities in a larger context Think of where you are today and where you want to be in five years Look at the activities that you are engaged in today and determine which of them can have the greatest impact on your future This way of thinking will allow you to manage your time much better than you can idea gained in a period of solitude or contemplation can save you months and even years of hard work Long Time Perspective Dr Edward Banfield of Harvard University conducted more than fifty years of research into the attitudes and behaviors He identified one special quality that seemed to separate the high performers from the low performers He called it long time perspective Banfield found that high performers took American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT wanted to be in their lives and work at that time They then come back to the present and make sure that everything they are doing in the moment is consistent with where they want to be in the future your life situation is ideal in every way Create a clear mental picture of what your work situation would be if it were per yourself if what you are doing right now is consistent with the creation of your ideal future take to get to where you want to go This back from the future thinking is a practice of many top executives Make Better Decisions in the Present very successful in business in her adult life With this clear extra hours to get excellent grades in high school so that she harder courses and studies much longer than her peers to graduate as close as possible to the top of her class American Management Association www amanet org where she has the opportunity to get paid more and pro moted faster than classmates who were not really thinking about the future at all When you are clear about where you want to be some decisions in the present The rule is that long term vision improves short term decision making You have heard the get you there The habit of developing long time perspective is quite powerful By projecting into the future and looking back to and mistakes that you could avoid This exercise will help you to crystallize your values It will give you the internal tools to organize your time and activities so that what you are doing today is moving you toward the creation of your ideal future Ready for Time Management Techniques don t want to get there any faster If you are not moving in managing your time in a way that accelerates your speed of accomplishment Time management strategies and tactics applied without a clear future vision will get you to a desti American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT management techniques that are available to you American Management Association www amanet org FIVE Make Written Plans ALL SUCCESSFUL TIME managers are good planners They make lists and sublists to accomplish each major and minor objective Whenever a new project crosses their project There is a rule that every minute spent in planning saves ten minutes in execution The time you take to think you invest in planning your work in the first place American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT of everything that you can think of that you will have to do to achieve that goal Keep adding new items to the list as you two ways by sequence and by priority step before completion of the goal or project As Henry Ford down into enough small parts percent of the items on your list will account for per cent of the value and importance of all the things you do Setting priorities allows you to stay focused on your key tasks and activities without getting distracted As Goethe mercy of the things that matter least ence frustration or resistance of any kind Be prepared to revise your plans when you receive new information or feed large and small Continually seek them out When you and insights about how to complete the task faster and better than you may have thought initially Action without planning is the cause of every failure Resist the temptation to take action before you have planned it out thoroughly in advance American Management Association www amanet org MAKE WRITTEN PLANS Planning for Goal Achievement Perhaps the most important word related to success of any kind is clarity Successful people are very clear about who plans of action that they follow every day Once you have set a larger goal for yourself and your What are the difficulties and obstacles that stand between you and the achievement of your goal Why aren t you at your goal already What is holding you back What goal in the end percent of the problems that account for percent of the obstacles between you and your goal required to achieve your goal or complete your project today is not enough to get you any further Where can you acquire the additional knowledge and skills that you need to achieve your goal Can you buy or hire the knowledge or information Do you need to develop new skills in yourself in order to achieve your full potential in your work What information is essential to you in making the right decisions in the process of achieving your goal American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT hurts him it s what he knows that isn t true help and cooperation you need in order to achieve your goal than you ever thought possible It s the same reason many businesspeople enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances with their competitors in order to offer products and services to each other s customers that each of them does not currently offer who is the most important person of all What could you offer in exchange to gain this person s help and cooperation so that you achieve your important goals even faster detailed plans of action before they begin Make written plans carefully until they are successful American Management Association www amanet org SIX Chart Your Projects MOST wWoRK IN business is a series of projects Your ability to complete projects largely determines your success in your career A project is defined as a multitask job A project is a result that requires the completion of a series of many smaller jobs Perhaps the most powerful tool you can use to maximize your effectiveness and dramatically increase your level of accomplishment is a checklist A checklist consists of a writ in advance of beginning work in the first place Your ability to clearly define and determine the steps that you will have to take from where you are today to a success fully completed project is a mark of superior thinking The American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT creating checklists will save you ten minutes in execution and getting the job done This is another example of slow thinking that can significantly increase your effectiveness Create a PERT Chart Create a visual representation of your larger tasks and proj ects so that you and others can see it in its totality Begin by determining the goals and objectives you must achieve to enjoy the outcomes you desire Start with the end in mind Take the time to develop absolute clarity about what your goals would look like if they were accomplished you need to take to get from where you are to where you want to be The use of a PERT chart which stands for Program Evaluation Review Technique sets out graphically all the steps you need to take and when each one needs to be fin ished for you to achieve the final goal This technique is used by the most efficient and effective companies and executives worldwide A PERT chart enables you to see a variety of ways to achieve the task with greater efficiency There are many forms and styles available online for you to choose from One example is depicted in Figure draw a line plotted backward from the required date of com pletion Lay it out on paper so that you can see when you American Management Association www amanet org CHART YOUR PROJECTS programming test code test system create schedule write man training buy hardware installation conversion Fig Sample PERT Chart Numbered rectangles are nades and represent events or milestones Directional arrows represent dependent tasks that must be completed sequentially Dotted lines indicate dependent tasks that do not require resources have to accomplish each part of the task in order to have the entire job completed on schedule complete control of the sequence of events You have a track to run on You have a series of tasks that you can check on to be sure that they are completed on schedule and to a satis being overwhelmed by deadlines You are always on top of your work and your major projects can set your time line with plenty of cushion at the fifteenth American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT problems arise Always remember Murphy s Law Whatever can go wrong will go wrong The superior executive assumes that there will be prob the job by the agreed on schedule These occurrences are a normal and natural part of business life Your job is to keep to solve the problems and remove the obstacles that are you may be quite amazed at how much more you accom plish and how many fewer hiccups or conflicts there will be between the steps Set Clear Goals for Everyone key person involved in the project than you ever could with what gets measured gets done A goal without a deadline is not really a goal It is merely a discussion For every goal or subgoal in the completion of a job or Who is going to perform this task When does the task need ask these questions Never assume that people know what you want unless you have made it perfectly clear General Motors went from massive losses and bank American Management Association www amanet org CHART YOUR PROJECTS the company s turnaround was the setting of clear goals for each key person and at each level of the organization employees knew exactly what they had to do to keep their job and to move ahead results American Management Association www amanet org SEVEN Create Your Daily To Do List PERHAPS THE MOST powerful time management tool is a daily list of activities that you create to serve as a blueprint for your day All successful time managers think on paper and work from a daily list of activities Just as a pilot uses a checklist to create a to do list before they begin each day subconscious mind can work on your list while you sleep and insights to help you achieve some of the most important goals on your list plan out the next day In a study of more than fifty highly American Management Association www amanet org CREATE YOUR DAILY TO DO LIST that the best time management system they had ever found was a simple pad of paper on which they wrote down every thing they had to do before they began Sleep Better Many people toss and turn at night trying not to forget something they have to do the following day If you create a and awake more refreshed twelve minutes each day to write out a list of your tasks for that day But this list will save you ten times that amount of time in improved productivity Twelve minutes spent in begin work That s an incredible payoff for such a simple task The ABCDE Method Once you have made up a list of everything that you plan to method to your activities The most important word in time management is conse quences A task is important depending on the potential consequences of doing it or not doing it When you set pri begin with the task that has the greatest consequences This is where the ABCDE method is especially helpful American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT Begin by making a list of everything you have to do the item on your list before you begin work An item that s marked A is something you must do It is something that is important and there are serious conse quences for either doing it or not doing it Put an A next to those tasks and activities that you must accomplish in the course of the day if you are to fulfill your responsibilities B items are those things you should do There are mild not as important as A activities The rule is that you never do a B activity when there is an A activity left undone not you do them has no consequences at all in terms of your effectiveness at your job Time Wastage Sabotages Careers Robert Half International estimates that as much as per make no contribution at all to the business Each person isa creature of habit Effective people estab lish good habits and make them their masters Ineffective habits govern their lives Many people get into the habit of coming in to work and American Management Association www amanet org CREATE YOUR DAILY TO DO LIST But whatever you do repeatedly soon becomes a habit It is unfortunate that the great majority of people at work today have established the habit of wasting most of their time on activities that contribute nothing to their businesses or to their careers Don t let this happen to you Delegate Everything Possible that you can delegate to someone else The rule is that you should delegate everything that you possibly can to other people to free up more time for you to engage in your A largely determine the entire course of your career An E activity is something that you should eliminate alto stop doing things that are no longer necessary for you to do It is normal and natural for people to slip into a comfort zone in the course of their work and career They become comfortable doing certain activities in a certain way Even after they have been promoted to higher level responsibili this activity at all If it would make little or no difference to American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT Plan Your Work and Work Your Plan Never do anything that is not on your list If a new task or for it before you start work on it Ifyou don t write down new of your day and end up spending most of your time on activ ities of low or no value Any time management system is better than no time Management system at all There are many smartphone apps to help you manage your time There are time manage ment systems that you can install on your computer You can use a written time management system that you carry with you and update regularly you have to sell is your time Be sure that you are focusing your time on the most valuable and important things that you can do to make the most important contribution to your business The Not To Do List you need a not to do list to help keep you on track These are any activity that does not represent the highest value of your time American Management Association www amanet org CREATE YOUR DAILY TO DO LIST No is the greatest time saving word in the world of gets easier and easier to say When people ask you if you would do something or help thank you for asking Let me think about it and look at my schedule I ll get back to you and let you know whether or not I can help you out suggest that maybe next time you will have an opening on your calendar already full You already have vastly more work than you can ever get done You will never get caught up on your current have your time completely under your own control American Management Association www amanet org EIGHT Set Clear Priorities HAVE STUDIED time management for more than thirty books of my own on time management that are worldwide and conducted seminars and workshops on time manage ment all over the world What I discovered was simple All of time management boils down to helping you determine the most important tools and techniques to begin immediately with that one American Management Association www amanet org SET CLEAR PRIORITIES I explained the ABCDE method in the last chapter It is one of the most powerful priority setting methods ever dis covered There are a series of additional techniques that you can also use to set priorities The Pareto Principle accumulation of fortunes in every society After years of families those he called the vital few controlled per cent of the wealth and property throughout Europe The rule seems to apply to almost all areas of cent of the value of all the work that you do Peter Drucker says that often it is the rule Sometimes percent of the work that you do will account for percent of the value When you start off each day with a list of your tasks and list and select the top percent of tasks that can make the greatest contribution to achieving your most important goals and objectives If you have a list of ten items to accom more than all the others put together Your ability to clearly identify those two items and act on them first will largely determine your success in your career American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT Put on the Pressure Here s another technique that you can use for setting priori ties Make up your daily list of activities and then ask your to complete before I left town The greatest enemy of time management and personal productivity today is majoring in minors Because of the natural tendency for each person to follow the path of least beginning of the day the day quickly becomes the pattern that you will follow in you have spent all of your time on small and meaningless Get More Important Things Done Another technique you can use is to imagine that you come into work on Monday morning and your boss approaches you with a dilemma He has just won a fully paid vacation His problem is that he is too busy to take advantage of this tomorrow morning Your boss makes you a deal If you can get all of your American Management Association www amanet org SET CLEAR PRIORITIES paid vacation would you do You would probably be astonished at how much work you could get done in that single day You would probably complete the top percent of the tasks that you had planned for the entire week single minute You would have no time at all for idle conver sation with your coworkers You would start early and im mediately work through coffee breaks and lunch and concentrate single mindedly on clearing your desk by com pleting your most important tasks You would become one ally overnight This is a great exercise for you to practice on yourself This exercise just illustrates the fact that your efficiency and effectiveness is largely a matter of choice With a suffi immediately become one of the most valuable people in your organization The Law of Three This principle is probably worth the cost and time of reading this book It is based on an amazing discovery that I have American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT three tasks and activities that account for percent of the value of the contribution you make to your business If you make a list of everything you do in the course ofa different tasks and responsibilities But if you review that list on your entire list account for percent of your value to your business How do you determine your big three Simple Make a which one activity would contribute the greatest value to my business Your most important task the one that accounts for the greatest contribution you can make to your busi ness will probably pop out at you from the list It will usu you Put a circle around that item what would be the second activity that would make the great but it is usually clear and obvious what would be the third activity that would contribute the American Management Association www amanet org SET CLEAR PRIORITIES you will clearly see that only three things you do account for almost all the value that you contribute Starting and completing these tasks is more important than everything else you do Here s an important point If you do not know the You are in great danger of wasting your time and your life at work If you do not know the answer to these magic ques often no value activities what your boss thinks are the three most important things that you do to make your most valuable contribution at work Ask your coworkers Ask your spouse But whatever Pass It Along the people who report to you gain clarity about their big three as well There is no kinder or more generous thing that you can do for your staff members than to help them become absolutely clear about the most important things that they do to make the most valuable contribution to your business ees know exactly what the most important things are that they could do to make the greatest contribution At the same American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT big tasks People who are dominated by fast thinking naturally react and respond to the demands and pressures of the moment They continually veer off track and away from working on their highest priority tasks But this practice is not for you task to the exclusion of everything else American Management Association www amanet org NINE Stay on Track WHAT IS THE most valuable use of my time right now Because it is the most important question in all of time automatic guide that motivates and drives you to focus on your highest value task or activity When you organize all of your time and work activities around the answer to this able financial asset After they have thought it over and given me a couple of earning ability Your ability to earn money represents as American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT much as percent to percent of your financial value in the world of work Think of yourself as an earning machine Every task high or low Your job is to focus on the most valuable use of your time and to discipline yourself to continually work on those few activities that contribute the greatest value to your work and to your business A Lifestyle Principle This selection of the most valuable use of your time applies to is to go home and go to bed early and get a good night s sleep Sometimes the most valuable use of your time is to spend it face to face with the important people in your life Sometimes the most valuable use of your time is to take excellent care of ation that you need to perform at your best Sometimes the most valuable use of your time is just to spend it with your family or to read a good book rather than of your time will be to socialize to get together with family and friends whose company you enjoy so that you can relax and de stress What matters most is for you to always be asking yourself this question What is the most valuable use of my time right now And then you discipline yourself to start and complete American Management Association www amanet org STAY ON TRACK this one suggestion into your time management skills and managers of your generation The Important vs the Urgent largely about separating the vital few from the trivial many There are four different types of tasks that you are faced with every day Your ability to sort out these tasks into their proper categories can significantly increase your pro ductivity Each of these tasks can be put into a different box or quadrant QUADRANT URGENT AND IMPORTANT An important task is something that has long term conse quences for your career An urgent task is something that can not be delayed or put off A task that is both urgent and important is something that is in your face It is largely deter sibilities that you must start and complete in order to keep on are expecting you to accomplish Most people spend most of their working day on tasks that are both vital and urgent both urgent and important This is called the quadrant of immediacy American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT The second type of tasks are those that are important but least for the short term An example of a task that is vital but not urgent is an important report that you must have Or think about a college term paper It is something that is often is Most term papers are written the night before the deadline What was at one time vital but not urgent suddenly becomes very urgent indeed fail or underachieve in business have unfortunately put off upgrading their skills and abilities for so long that they are mined and aggressive people who want to enjoy greater rewards and responsibilities Even something as simple as physical exercise is vital to cent of the major health problems that people have later in life could have been avoided if they had engaged in proper health lives These tasks fall into the quadrant of effectiveness American Management Association www amanet org STAY ON TRACK them contribute little or no value to your business or your work They represent tasks that are urgent but not important These tasks fall into what is often called the quadrant of delusion People think that because they are engaging in vance Many people spend as much as half of their time engaging in activities that are urgent but not important They to the work at all Most of these activities involve idle conver QUADRANT NOT URGENT AND NOT IMPORTANT The fourth type of activity that people engage in at work are those tasks that are neither urgent nor important These activ ities fall into the quadrant of waste Many people engage in activities that have zero value to either themselves or the appointments listening to the radio all are examples of activities that are neither urgent nor important They are a complete waste of time They contribute nothing to your life Develop Good Work Habits American Management Association www amanet org TIME MANAGEMENT break Many people have developed the habit of spending most of their time on low value no value activities

Your desire will reinforce your determination. time management a lifelong practice. Effective discipline is whether you feel like it or not. This is critical for success. American Management Association / www.amanet.org INTRODUCTION 3 The payoff for becoming an excellent time manager is huge. It is the outwardly identifiable quality of a high per- former vs. a low performer. All winners in life use their time well. All poor performers in life use their time poorly. One of the most important rules for success is simply to “form good learn how to form good habits and then let them form you. What you will learn in this book are the twenty-one most important solutions to effective time management that almost all highly productive people have discovered and incorporated into their lives.

Each one sup- ports and reinforces the other. The Law of Control The psychology of time management is based on a simple principle called the Law of Control. This law says that you feel good about yourself to the degree to which you feel you are in control of your own life. This law also says that you feel negative about yourself to the degree to which you feel that you are not in control of your own life or work. Psychologists refer to the difference between an internal feel that you are controlled by circumstances outside yourself. pressure of your work and responsibilities. You feel that you really in charge of your time and your life. Most of what you external events. There is a big difference between action that is self- immediate response to external pressure.

Your Thoughts and Feelings internal master program that regulates his behavior in every important area of life. People with a high self-concept regarding time management see themselves and think about themselves as being well organized and productive. They are very much in charge of their lives and their work. especially regarding the way you manage your time. Some people believe themselves to be extremely well organized and efficient. Others feel continuously overwhelmed by demands of other people and circumstances. Beliefs Become Realities What are your beliefs about yourself and your ability to manage your own time? Do you see yourself and think about yourself as a highly efficient and effective time manager? Do you believe you are highly productive and in complete con- urally do those things that are consistent with that belief.

Visualize Yourself as You Want to Be The second way to transform your behaviors is to visualize yourself as an excellent time manager. See yourself as orga - person you “see” on the inside is the person you will “be” on the outside. If you are already a well-organized and highly productive different from the way you behave today?

American Management Association / www.amanet.org THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TIME MANAGEMENT 9 Imagine what a highly productive person would look like. Would the person’s desk be clear and tidy? Would the person appear unhurried and unstressed? Create a clear mental picture of yourself as a person who is in control of his time and life. Act “As If” The third way to program yourself is to act “as if” you were already a good time manager. Think of yourself as being well organized in everything you do. If you were already excellent you be doing differently? With regard to your time and per- you do things now? American Management Association / www.amanet.org TWO Determine Your Values improving your personal productivity begins with an exam- ination of your values. One of Murphy’s Laws says that It’s not possible to manage your time properly unless you know exactly what your values are. Good time management requires that you bring your control over a sequence of events into harmony with what is will never feel motivated and determined to get control of your time. Ask yourself this: “Why am I doing what I am doing?” Why do you get up in the morning? Why do you do the job you do? What is your reason for working where you work? American Management Association / www.amanet.org DETERMINE YOUR VALUES 11 Meaning and Purpose Each person has a deep need for meaning and purpose in life. One of the major reasons for personal stress and unhap- piness is the feeling that what you are doing has no meaning and purpose as it applies to you and your innermost values and convictions. You must always start off by asking the question “Why?” You can become more efficient with time management more efficient at doing something that is meaningless to you. Greater efficiency will simply increase your sense of What Do You Value Most? most in life?” What do you really care about and stand for? What will you not stand for? to the degree to which your day-to-day activities are in har- one thing while you believe and value something com- pletely different. There are many reports about executives experiencing burnout as the result of the stress of their work. But people experience stress or burnout of any kind. When you are American Management Association / www.amanet.org 12 TIME MANAGEMENT comes from working at things that are not consistent with your highest values. You Are Extraordinary Realize and accept that you are a unique and wonderful per- son. Your values have grown and evolved over the course of your entire lifetime. They have emerged as the result of countless influences and experiences. They are part of your psychological and emotional DNA. They are part of your character and personality. They seldom change over time. Your job is to determine what your innermost values really working consistent with those values. Analyze Yourself Here are four sentence completion exercises that you can use to gain better insight into the person you really are inside. Complete each sentence: really?” what would be your answer? What are the first words that you would use to describe yourself? Would you describe American Management Association / www.amanet.org DETERMINE YOUR VALUES 13 other people describe you in terms of your values and the person you really are? Based on the way you behave and about the person you are inside? around you. How would you describe the human race? Are untrustworthy? Your answer will have a major influence on how you treat other people in every part of your life. It will determine just about everything you will accomplish as an executive and as a person with family and friends. One of my favorite stories is about a young man who nothing at all.” What is life to you? American Management Association / www.amanet.org 14 TIME MANAGEMENT a. “My biggest goal in life is...” If you could wave a magic “My biggest goal in my career is...” “My biggest goal for my family is...” These are some of the most profound and important questions you can ever ask and answer for yourself. When you become clear about your answers—which will not be easy—you can then ask yourself what changes you would need to make to bring your time usage and your life priorities more into alignment with each other. Napoleon Hill observed that life only begins to become great when we decide clearly upon our most important goal in life. What are your most important goals? American Management Association / www.amanet.org THREE Think About Your Vision and Mission ONE OF THE BEST and most profound books written in the His insight is that we need to use two different types of thinking to deal with the variety of situations we face in our daily lives. Fast thinking is the type of thinking that we use to deal and situations. We act quickly and instinctively. In most day activities. The second type of thinking that Kahneman describes is slow thinking. That’s when you step back and take more time to carefully think through the details of the situation before deciding what you are going to do. Kahneman’s American Management Association / www.amanet.org 16 TIME MANAGEMENT insight is that the failure to engage in slow thinking when it is required and necessary is the cause of many of the mis- takes that we make in life. am I trying to do?” Think Before Acting Very often you can find yourself working extremely hard at and think about what it is you really want to accomplish. There is the story of the husband and wife who leave on a car trip from San Diego to Los Angeles. He is unfamiliar with the road but driving at full speed in any case.

Are you working because you accomplish something that is very important? What would your world look like if you accomplished your biggest goal? What is your vision for yourself and your career over the long term? What is your mission? What dif- ference do you want to make in the lives of other people? If all you are working for is to earn enough money to pay tain a high level of commitment and enthusiasm. To be truly makes a difference in the life or work of others.

Once you are clear about what you are trying to do and tion: “How is it going?” Is what you are doing moving you toward what you want in the fastest and most efficient way? Are you happy with your too many roadblocks and obstacles on your journey? What are your assumptions about your work and your life? What are your conscious assumptions? What are your unconscious and often unquestioned assumptions? It is amazing how many hardworking people are laboring on the basis of false assumptions that they have never questioned. Seek a Better Way also be considering another important question: “Could there be a better way?” The fact is that there is almost always a different and bet- ter way to achieve a business goal. This other way may be American Management Association / www.amanet.org THINK ABOUT YOUR VISION AND MISSION 19 than just increasing its speed.” Many people are working very hard but going in the wrong direction on the wrong path. They are not clear about but they don’t want to face or deal with the possibility that they could be wrong. The process of asking tough questions speed at which you achieve your business goals and your vision and mission. American Management Association / www.amanet.org FOUR Look Backward WHAT IS THE MOST important and valuable work that you think clearly about what you do and how you do it will have a greater impact on your future results than any other single action you take. There are some areas of your work where “slow thinking” is absolutely essential for you to perform at your best.

Think of where you are today and where you want to be in five years. Look at the activities that you are engaged in today and determine which of them can have the greatest impact on your future. This way of thinking will allow you to manage your time much better than you can idea gained in a period of solitude or contemplation can save you months and even years of hard work. Long Time Perspective Dr. Edward Banfield of Harvard University conducted more than fifty years of research into the attitudes and behaviors He identified one special quality that seemed to separate the high performers from the low performers. He called it “long time perspective.” Banfield found that high performers took American Management Association / www.amanet.org 22 TIME MANAGEMENT wanted to be in their lives and work at that time.

What could you offer in exchange to gain this person’s help and cooperation so that you achieve your important goals even faster? detailed plans of action before they begin. Make written plans carefully until they are successful. American Management Association / www.amanet.org SIX Chart Your Projects MOST wWoRK IN business is a series of projects. Your ability to complete projects largely determines your success in your career. A project is defined as a “multitask job.” A project is a result that requires the completion of a series of many smaller jobs. Perhaps the most powerful tool you can use to maximize your effectiveness and dramatically increase your level of accomplishment is a checklist. A checklist consists of a writ- in advance of beginning work in the first place. Your ability to clearly define and determine the steps that you will have to take from where you are today to a success- fully completed project is a mark of superior thinking. The American Management Association / www.amanet.org 30 TIME MANAGEMENT creating checklists will save you ten minutes in execution and getting the job done. This is another example of slow thinking that can significantly increase your effectiveness Create a PERT Chart Create a visual representation of your larger tasks and proj- ects so that you and others can see it in its totality. Begin by determining the goals and objectives you must achieve to enjoy the outcomes you desire. Start with the end in mind. Take the time to develop absolute clarity about what your goals would look like if they were accomplished you need to take to get from where you are to where you want to be. The use of a PERT chart (which stands for Program Evaluation Review Technique) sets out graphically all the steps you need to take and when each one needs to be fin- ished for you to achieve the final goal. This technique is used by the most efficient and effective companies and executives worldwide. A PERT chart enables you to see a variety of ways to achieve the task with greater efficiency. There are many forms and styles available online for you to choose from. One example is depicted in Figure 1. draw a line plotted backward from the required date of com- pletion.

American Management Association / www.amanet.org SEVEN Create Your Daily “To-Do” List PERHAPS THE MOST powerful time management tool is a daily list of activities that you create to serve as a blueprint for your day. All successful time managers think on paper and work from a daily list of activities. Just as a pilot uses a checklist to create a “to-do” list before they begin each day. subconscious mind can work on your list while you sleep. and insights to help you achieve some of the most important goals on your list. plan out the next day. In a study of more than fifty highly American Management Association / www.amanet.org CREATE YOUR DAILY “TO-DO” LIST 35 that the best time management system they had ever found was a simple pad of paper on which they wrote down every- thing they had to do before they began. Sleep Better Many people toss and turn at night trying not to forget something they have to do the following day. If you create a and awake more refreshed. twelve minutes each day to write out a list of your tasks for that day. But this list will save you ten times that amount of time in improved productivity. Twelve minutes spent in begin work. That’s an incredible payoff for such a simple task. The ABCDE Method Once you have made up a list of everything that you plan to method to your activities. The most important word in time management is conse- quences. A task is important depending on the potential consequences of doing it or not doing it. When you set pri- begin with the task that has the greatest consequences. This is where the ABCDE method is especially helpful. American Management Association / www.amanet.org 36 TIME MANAGEMENT Begin by making a list of everything you have to do the item on your list before you begin work. An item that’s marked A is something you must do. It is something that is important and there are serious conse- quences for either doing it or not doing it. Put an A next to those tasks and activities that you must accomplish in the course of the day if you are to fulfill your responsibilities. B items are those things you should do. There are mild not as important as A activities. The rule is that you never do a B activity when there is an A activity left undone. not you do them has no consequences at all in terms of your effectiveness at your job. Time Wastage Sabotages Careers Robert Half International estimates that as much as 50 per- make no contribution at all to the business. Each person isa creature of habit.

Many people get into the habit of coming in to work and American Management Association / www.amanet.org CREATE YOUR DAILY “TO-DO” LIST 37 But whatever you do repeatedly soon becomes a habit. It is unfortunate that the great majority of people at work today have established the habit of wasting most of their time on activities that contribute nothing to their businesses or to their careers. Don't let this happen to you. Delegate Everything Possible that you can delegate to someone else.

American Management Association / www.amanet.org EIGHT Set Clear Priorities | HAVE STUDIED time management for more than thirty books of my own on time management that are worldwide and conducted seminars and workshops on time manage- ment all over the world. What I discovered was simple: All of time management boils down to helping you determine the most important tools and techniques to begin immediately with that one American Management Association / www.amanet.org SET CLEAR PRIORITIES 41 I explained the ABCDE method in the last chapter. It is one of the most powerful priority-setting methods ever dis- covered. There are a series of additional techniques that you can also use to set priorities.

The 80/20 rule seems to apply to almost all areas of cent of the value of all the work that you do. Peter Drucker says that often it is the “90/10 rule.” Sometimes 10 percent of the work that you do will account for 90 percent of the value. When you start off each day with a list of your tasks and list and select the top 20 percent of tasks that can make the greatest contribution to achieving your most important goals and objectives. If you have a list of ten items to accom- more than all the others put together. Your ability to clearly identify those two items and act on them first will largely determine your success in your career.

You would probably be astonished at how much work you could get done in that single day. You would probably complete the top 20 percent of the tasks that you had planned for the entire week. single minute. You would have no time at all for idle conver- sation with your coworkers. You would start early and im- mediately work through coffee breaks and lunch and concentrate single-mindedly on clearing your desk by com- pleting your most important tasks. You would become one ally overnight. This is a great exercise for you to practice on yourself. This exercise just illustrates the fact that your efficiency and effectiveness is largely a matter of choice. With a suffi- immediately become one of the most valuable people in your organization.

It is based on an amazing discovery that I have American Management Association / www.amanet.org 44 TIME MANAGEMENT three tasks and activities that account for 90 percent of the value of the contribution you make to your business. If you make a list of everything you do in the course ofa different tasks and responsibilities. But if you review that list on your entire list account for 90 percent of your value to your business. How do you determine your “big three’? Simple. Make a which one activity would contribute the greatest value to my business? Your most important task—the one that accounts for the greatest contribution you can make to your busi- ness—will probably pop out at you from the list. It will usu- you.

The Important vs. the Urgent largely about separating the “vital few” from the “trivial many.” There are four different types of tasks that you are faced with every day. Your ability to sort out these tasks into their proper categories can significantly increase your pro- ductivity. Each of these tasks can be put into a different box or quadrant. QUADRANT 1: URGENT AND IMPORTANT An important task is something that has long-term conse- quences for your career. An urgent task is something that can- not be delayed or put off. A task that is both urgent and important is something that is “in your face.” It is largely deter- sibilities that you must start and complete in order to keep on are expecting you to accomplish. Most people spend most of their working day on tasks that are both vital and urgent. both urgent and important.

These activ- ities fall into the “quadrant of waste.” Many people engage in activities that have zero value to either themselves or the appointments listening to the radio—all are examples of activities that are neither urgent nor important. They are a complete waste of time. They contribute nothing to your life. Develop Good Work Habits American Management Association / www.amanet.org 52 TIME MANAGEMENT break. Many people have developed the habit of spending most of their time on low-value/no-value activities and then are quite astonished when they are laid off from their jobs or passed over for promotion. The key to good time management is for you to set prior- ities and to always be working on what is both urgent and Once you are caught up with your tasks that are urgent and are important but not urgent at the moment.

American Management Association / www.amanet.org ELEVEN Delegate to Others ONE OF THE GREATEST time management tools is for you to get someone else to do the task completely. Your ability to delegate lower-value tasks to others who can do them at a lower hourly rate or salary is one of the vital skills of modern management. Delegate everything you possibly can to others who can do the tasks as well as or better than you. Use the “70 percent rule.” If someone else can do a particular task 70 percent as your plate and on to that person's plate. Multiply Your Value Delegation enables you to move from what you can do personally to what you can manage. Delegation is the skill American Management Association / www.amanet.org 60 TIME MANAGEMENT that allows you to leverage your talent and skill and multi- ply it times all the people who can be given smaller parts of the work. can have someone else do it.

Choose the right person to handle each task. and a review schedule. You can also delegate problem solving and decision making if they are among your duties and responsibilities. You can delegate information gathering and research. You can delegate every task that anyone else can do as well as (or almost as well as) you. there is no limit that you cannot reach in your professional career. But without the ability to delegate efficiently and tle time. You will end up doing too many things of low value or no value. You will never get caught up and on top of your job.

Avoid Multitasking There is a good deal of argument today over the concept of multitasking. Some people feel that they are quite capable of performing at high levels of productivity while they are working on several tasks at once. The studies have now proven that this idea is totally false. What the experts have discovered is that multitasking is actually “task-shifting.” The fact is that you can only do one thing at a time.

American Management Association / www.amanet.org OVERCOME PROCRASTINATION 69 Completing Larger Tasks break it down into enough small parts.” Any big task that you have to complete can be completed if you break it down into enough small parts. One of the best techniques of all is to divide your task into “bite-size pieces.” Take a piece of paper and write down every small part of the to the final job that completes the task. forcing yourself to start on a major task will help you to develop the momentum and energy necessary to work right through until the task is complete. The Salami Slice Method A variation of the “bite-size pieces” technique for overcom- ing procrastination is called the “salami slice method.” Just salami-slice the task; you reduce the size of the task by slic- ing off one small part at a time.

You need a minimum of sixty to ninety minutes to accomplish anything worthwhile. It takes about thirty focused work. American Management Association / www.amanet.org 72 TIME MANAGEMENT Don’t Mix Creative and Administrative You cannot mix creative tasks with functional or administra- tive tasks. You cannot really do operational tasks and creative Think of creative time as your “internal prime time” and operational time as your “external prime time.” And don't mix them up. You cannot do big creative jobs requiring focus and concentration in a typical office environment unless you must be creative in finding ways to get away from your work environment so that you can complete the tasks that your career really depends on. How to Create Chunks of Time Here are several recommendations for creating blocks of tiveness and efficiency. and most alert. Many of the most productive people in business discipline themselves to go to bed early and then arise at 5:00 or 6:00 A.M. so that they can work for sixty to ninety minutes uninterrupted before they go into the office. as the average person does in an office environment in three hours. American Management Association / www.amanet.org CREATE BLOCKS OF TIME 73 Another time that you can use to your advantage is lunchtime. This is a great opportunity for you to shut off other distractions while everyone else is out of the office having lunch. You'll have sixty straight minutes of peace and quiet where you can work single-mindedly to clear up some of your most important tasks. Do Not Disturb Another strategy you can use is to close your office door for certain periods each day during which you work single- mindedly on your biggest tasks. Many executives will get a Do Nor Disturs sign from a hotel and hang it on their door handle at work. Everyone knows that while this sign is on the of areal emergency. to me that she was overwhelmed with nonstop interruptions detailed accounting work done and send out her financial statements and reports on schedule.

American Management Association / www.amanet.org 74 TIME MANAGEMENT Gain Extra Hours Here is yet another great technique that virtually all execu- tives on the fast track use. It is so simple that it should be ille- gal. Get up a little earlier and arrive at your office one hour before everyone else. Use that hour to organize your day and to get started before there are any possible interruptions. Then work through lunch and gain one more hour of pro- plete your most important tasks. This is an amazing technique!

These interruptions can be in the form of a bell going off on your because they need to talk. It turns out that people are the greatest time wasters in the world of work.

The only way to resist this temp- tation to be distracted is for you to turn off the phone com- pletely so that you don't even hear it ring. off your cell phone. Allow no interruptions whatsoever. There is seldom anything so important that it will not wait. Ten minutes of uninterrupted time in conversation with another individual will be more productive than thirty or forty minutes with the phone ringing and being answered Bunch Your Calls If you have to make a series of phone calls in the course of of time where you can turn off every other distraction and only make phone calls to the important people on your list. that you need to call. Schedule phone calls as religiously as you would sched- out your agenda for the call so that you are working from a list when you are talking to the other person.

        "TEXT=\"\"\"Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks.[1] It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.[2] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.[3]\n",
        "\n",
        "A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers, but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.[5][6] Some implementations of machine learning use data and neural networks in a way that mimics the working of a biological brain.[7][8] In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.\n",
        "\n",
        ",As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence. In the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what was then termed \"neural networks\"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics.[23] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.[24]: 488 \n",
        "\n",
        "However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.[24]: 488  By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.[25] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming, but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.[24]: 708–710, 755  Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \"connectionism\", by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield, Rumelhart and Hinton.

Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector, and the training data is represented by a matrix. Through iterative optimization of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.[35] An optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.[18]\n",

        "Types of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning, classification and regression.[26] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range. As an example, for a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email.\n",

The algorithms, therefore, learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. A central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of density estimation in statistics, such as finding the probability density function.[36] Though unsupervised learning encompasses other domains involving summarizing and explaining data features.\n",

        "Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation, the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity.\n",

In machine learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques.[38] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP, and are used when exact models are infeasible.
